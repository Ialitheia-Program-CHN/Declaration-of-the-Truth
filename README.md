# Declaration of the Truth (en-us)

In a world dominated by capitalists and dictators, it is necessary to declare the reasons and goals of a media that reveals the truth to the public in order to gain the support of the people.

We hold this truth to be self-evident, that knowing the truth is one of the inherent and unalienable rights of the people.

In order to know the truth in our busy lives, we organize and support a group of people, the media, to show us the truth. We cannot be sure who is telling the truth, but the truth will eventually dispel the lies, so we give everyone and every media the right to describe the truth as they see it, that is, freedom of speech, to help the result to be infinitely closer to the truth. Therefore, when the media hides the truth, when it becomes a tool for the capitalists to profit and for the dictators to rule, it is our right, it is our duty to reveal the truth and to restore freedom of speech.

Now is such a moment. To prove that the capitalists and dictators have committed the crime of concealing the truth, let the impartial people judge the following facts:

    (For now, we will complete this gradually, by the people and by us. You can leave a comment with facts and maybe some evidence, starting with "FACT: [who did it - what did they do]" and writing the details in the next line. Or submit a feature on GitHub, the title should be something like FACT: "[who did it - what did they do]")

We will not allow any of these lies and cover-ups, which is enough for us to declare war on the capitalists and dictators.

With a firm reliance on the protection of the people, we swear an oath on our freedom of speech, our right to know the truth, and our sacred honor:

    To reveal the truth to the public and restore freedom of speech, resisting the temptation of money and the threat of power. If I betray the truth, please dispel my lies with the truth.
